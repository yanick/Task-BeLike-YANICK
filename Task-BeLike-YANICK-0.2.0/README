Task-BeLike-YANICK

This task distribution will install all the modules I 
like and use.  

The prime goal of this Task module is entirely selfish:
provide me with the mean to quickly turn any 
unsuspecting computer into something that feels like
home.  But, at the same time, it can be used by others
to want to share my environment, or just are curious to
see what are my weapons of choice.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
