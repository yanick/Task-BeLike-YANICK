    This Task module installs the modules that I use on a regular basis.

    regular basis! To do that, do

        TASK_UPGRADE=1 cpan -f Task::BeLike::YANICK

MODULES INSTALLED BY THIS TASK
  General
    Task::Kensho
        Might not use'em all, but I want them all near me, just in case.

    Set::CrossProduct
            my $iterator = Set::CrossProduct->new([
                [ a..z ],
                [ 1..10 ],
            ]);

            while( my $i = $iterator->get ) {
                print @$i;
            }

    Algorithm::Combinatorics
        Permutations are fun!

  Object-Oriented Frameworks
    Moose
    MooseX::Declare

  XML Processing
    XML::LibXML
    XML::Writer
        Because writing XML should be left to professionals.

    XML::Simple
        Useful for quick'n'dirty XML creation or slurping.

    XML::XPathScript
        Can't leave out my baby, now, can I?

  Applications
    App::GitGot
        Git repo herder.

    App::Ack
        "grep" is nice, but "ack" is just nicer.

    App::HTTPThis
        Want to share a directory over http?

            $ cd /path/to/dir/we/wanna/share
            $ http_this

    Module::Info
        Want to know where the module is?

            module_info Task::BeLike::YANICK

  Web Development
    Dancer
        So you think you can dance?

    Dancer::Template::Mason
    Dancer::Plugin::Cache::CHI
    Catalyst::Runtime
    HTML::Mason
        My templating system of choice.

    Template
        I prefer HTML::Mason, but "TT" is used in an awful lot of
        applications.

    WWW::Mechanize
        A must for testing and small web hacks. Plus, this module name
        always reminds me of *Battletech*.

  Version Control Systems
    Git::CPAN::Patch
        Effortlessly import CPAN distros in a Git repository.

  Testing
    Test::Class
        Add some class to your testing.

    Test::Perl::Critic
    Test::Perl::Critic::Progressive
        Raise the bar, millimeter by millimeter.

  Development
    Method::Signatures
    Carp::Always::Color
        "You're going to tell me what you know. EVERYTHING you know..."

        "...and you are going to tell me... IN COLORS!"

    autodie
        Because my minions should know that their missions should always
        either end in success, or death...

        Part of the core as of 5.10.1.

    Const::Fast
        First, there was constant, then Readonly, and now Const::Fast.

    Perl::Tidy
        Because tidy code is so easier to read.

    Perl::Critic
    Module::Which
        Which version of *Foo::Bar* am I running, and in which lib directory
        is it hidding?

    Pod::POM::Web
        Because search.cpan.org doesn't deserved to be poked every five
        minutes.

  CPAN
    App::cpanminus
        Slam, bang, thank you CPAN.

    CPAN::SQLite
        CPAN asks for it, so there it is.

        Github actions.
